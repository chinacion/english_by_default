Once upon a time, in a prosperous empire ruled by a wise emperor, there was a regent named Robert. He was known for his exact nature and meticulous attention to detail in governing the kingdom. However, there was a lack of consensus among the emperor's council on the issue of methane emissions from the kingdom's agricultural sector.
一段时间以前，在一个由智慧的皇帝统治的繁荣帝国中，有一位名叫罗伯特的摄政。他因他精确的性格和对细节的周密关注而闻名于国内外，他管理着这个国家时，却因国内农业部门甲烷排放的问题而无法达成一致意见。


The emperor sought guidance from his trusted physician, who argued for sustainable farming practices and the use of natural fertilizers to reduce emissions. He proposed a practical philosophy that involved sustainable farming methods and the use of electrical equipment to reduce methane emissions.
皇帝向他值得信赖的医师寻求指导，医师主张持续的农业实践和使用天然肥料来减少排放。他提出了一种可行的理念，希望通过可持续的农业方法和电气化设备来减少甲烷排放。
